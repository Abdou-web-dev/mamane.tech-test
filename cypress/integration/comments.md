This Cypress test is quite comprehensive and covers various aspects of the checkout functionality. Here's a breakdown of the positive and negative scenarios # I've covered:

Positive Scenarios:

# I've filled in necessary details (email and name).

# I've clicked on the checkout button.

# I've checked the appearance of product items and their details.

# I've clicked on the address and CVV input fields and checked their attributes.

# I've triggered the checkout process and checked for loading and non-loading states.

# I've used spies to check if the constructJson function is called when clicking the checkout button.

# I've filled in all required fields with valid data and clicked the checkout button.

# I've checked for the success message after placing the order successfully.

Negative Scenarios:

# I've attempted to click the checkout button without filling in all the required fields.

# I've checked the appearance of error states, such as the border becoming red for empty email and invalid CVV.

checkout.spec.js file includes both end-to-end (E2E) and integration tests. Here's a breakdown:

End-to-End (E2E) Tests:

# E2E tests typically simulate real user scenarios and interactions with the application.

In this test, scenarios like filling in the necessary details, clicking the checkout button, and checking for the success message constitute E2E testing.
These actions mimic a user's journey through the application, testing the entire flow from input to the final result.
Integration Tests:

# Integration tests focus on testing the interaction between different components or modules within the application.

In this test, checking the appearance and attributes of various elements (e.g., product items, input fields) can be considered integration testing.
Additionally, using spies to observe the constructJson function's behavior involves testing the integration of different parts of the application.
